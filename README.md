To play Windows:
  Download Radiation_windows_Data folder and Radiation_windows.exe
  Run Radiation_windows.exe

To play Mac: 
  Download Radiation_Mac.app/Contents folder.
  Open Radiation_Mac.app/Contents -> MacOS -> Radiation_Mac

Bug Warning:
  Occasionally the pause menu does not appear immediately upon starting a new game. To fix this A) Move from initial spawn, or B) hit Esc multiple times until it appears. It should be fully functional afterwards.
 
Additional info:
  Stay tuned for updates! (Windows only, because I (Matt) want to continue adding features.)
